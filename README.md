# Incoming Package Monitoring Dashboard

This project aims to create a dashboard for monitoring incoming packages in the logistics industry. It will use **Python** to clean the data and **Google Data Studio** for visualization. 

## Data Cleaning

The data used for this dashboard is collected from a central web application which we collect every day in the form of a CSV extension. if all the csv data has been collected then we can combine the data and after it can be cleaned and transformed, it will be necessary to first convert it into the same format. Python will be used to handle this step. Python's built-in libraries, such as Pandas and Numpy, will be used to read the data, clean it up, and convert it into the required format. For cleaning and transformation step can be seen on **[this notebook]**(incoming.ipynb).

## Data Visualization

Once the data is cleaned up and ready for use, the next step is to create a dashboard to monitor the incoming packages. Google Data Studio will be used to create the dashboard. It will be used to create interactive visualizations, such as charts, tables, and maps. These visualizations will give an overview of the incoming packages and help to identify trends and patterns.

For now, we can't provide the link to the dashboard, because it is private and only those who have authority can access the dashboard.
